Feature: Fibonacci recursion

Scenario 1: The one where we compute the first 5 fibonacci numbers
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the first 5 numbers in the sequence
  Then the fib result set length should be 5
  And the fib set should contain 1
  And the fib set should contain 2
  And the fib set should contain 3
  And the fib set should contain 5

Scenario 2: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 1
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 1
  Then the fib result should be 1

Scenario 3: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 2
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 2
  Then the fib result should be 1

Scenario 4: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 3
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 3
  Then the fib result should be 2

Scenario 5: The one where we find the fibonacci number of 4
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the Fibonacci number of 4
  Then the fib result should be 3

Scenario 6: The one where we compute the first 100 fibonacci numbers
  Given a fibonacci sequence calculator
  When I ask for the first 100 numbers in the sequence
  Then the fib result set length should be 10
  And the fib set should contain 55
  And the fib set should contain 34
  And the fib set should contain 21
